# OOP_Assignment_Hierarchical_Inheritance
This is the submission for Assignment 4/10/25 for OOP.

## About
This Python GUIed program handles EHR (Electronic Health Records). This is the first part of a two part assignment. This program specifically was built to demonstrate hierarchical inheritance for real-world applications.
For obvious reasons, all data within "patients.json", is faux or fake data with fake names, DOBs, and all other information.
NOTE: ANY and ALL other data within this repository is for EXAMPLE purposes ONLY for an online assignment submission. NO REAL PATIENT DATA IS/WAS USED OR DISTRIBUTED IN THE MAKING OF THIS APPLICATION!
## HIPAA
This application was not made for production purposes. The security of it is extremely crude thus not being HIPAA compliant.
## Assignment Instructions
Explain multilevel and hierarchical inheritance in your own words. Provide two real-world examples, implement them in Python, and explain the functionality of each program. Ensure that you write comments for each line.

Save the Jupyter file with your name and submit it.

Grading Breakdown:

10 points for explaining the concepts
40 points for explaining the examples
40 points for Python implementation
10 points for writing comments for each line
